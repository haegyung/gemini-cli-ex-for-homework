## PDF form filling

1. Extract form fields: `python scripts/analyze_form.py input.pdf` → `form_fields.json`
   (lists every field name, type, and whether it's required)
2. Create `field_values.json` mapping each field name to its intended value
3. Validate: `python scripts/validate_fields.py form_fields.json field_values.json`
   (checks that every field name exists in the form, types are compatible, and
   required fields aren't missing)
4. If validation fails, revise `field_values.json` and re-validate
5. Fill the form: `python scripts/fill_form.py input.pdf field_values.json output.pdf`
```

The key ingredient is step 3: a validation script that checks the plan (`field_values.json`) against the source of truth (`form_fields.json`). Errors like “Field ‘signature_date’ not found — available fields: customer_name, order_total, signature_date_signed” give the agent enough information to self-correct.

### Bundling reusable scripts

When [iterating on a skill](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills), compare the agent’s execution traces across test cases. If you notice the agent independently reinventing the same logic each run — building charts, parsing a specific format, validating output — that’s a signal to write a tested script once and bundle it in `scripts/`.For more on designing and bundling scripts, see [Using scripts in skills](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/using-scripts).
