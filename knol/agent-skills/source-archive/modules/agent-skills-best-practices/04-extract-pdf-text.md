## Extract PDF text

Use pdfplumber for text extraction. For scanned documents, fall back to
pdf2image with pytesseract.

```python
import pdfplumber

with pdfplumber.open("file.pdf") as pdf:
    text = pdf.pages[0].extract_text()
```
```

Ask yourself about each piece of content: “Would the agent get this wrong without this instruction?” If the answer is no, cut it. If you’re unsure, test it. And if the agent already handles the entire task well without the skill, the skill may not be adding value. See [Evaluating skill output quality](https://agentskills.io/skill-creation/evaluating-skills) for how to test this systematically.

### Design coherent units

Deciding what a skill should cover is like deciding what a function should do: you want it to encapsulate a coherent unit of work that composes well with other skills. Skills scoped too narrowly force multiple skills to load for a single task, risking overhead and conflicting instructions. Skills scoped too broadly become hard to activate precisely. A skill for querying a database and formatting the results may be one coherent unit, while a skill that also covers database administration is probably trying to do too much.

### Aim for moderate detail

Overly comprehensive skills can hurt more than they help — the agent struggles to extract what’s relevant and may pursue unproductive paths triggered by instructions that don’t apply to the current task. Concise, stepwise guidance with a working example tends to outperform exhaustive documentation. When you find yourself covering every edge case, consider whether most are better handled by the agent’s own judgment.

### Structure large skills with progressive disclosure

The [specification](https://agentskills.io/specification#progressive-disclosure) recommends keeping `SKILL.md` under 500 lines and 5,000 tokens — just the core instructions the agent needs on every run. When a skill legitimately needs more content, move detailed reference material to separate files in `references/` or similar directories.The key is telling the agent _when_ to load each file. “Read `references/api-errors.md` if the API returns a non-200 status code” is more useful than a generic “see references/ for details.” This lets the agent load context on demand rather than up front, which is how [progressive disclosure](https://agentskills.io/what-are-skills#how-skills-work) is designed to work.
