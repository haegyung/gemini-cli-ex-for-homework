## Gotchas

- The `users` table uses soft deletes. Queries must include
  `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` or results will include deactivated accounts.
- The user ID is `user_id` in the database, `uid` in the auth service,
  and `accountId` in the billing API. All three refer to the same value.
- The `/health` endpoint returns 200 as long as the web server is running,
  even if the database connection is down. Use `/ready` to check full
  service health.
```

Keep gotchas in `SKILL.md` where the agent reads them before encountering the situation. A separate reference file works if you tell the agent when to load it, but for non-obvious issues, the agent may not recognize the trigger.

### Templates for output format

When you need the agent to produce output in a specific format, provide a template. This is more reliable than describing the format in prose, because agents pattern-match well against concrete structures. Short templates can live inline in `SKILL.md`; for longer templates, or templates only needed in certain cases, store them in `assets/` and reference them from `SKILL.md` so they only load when needed.

```
